# Enhanced GPT Playground

An enhanced version of OpenAI's playground (https://platform.openai.com/playground).

**Still a WIP**

To get started, clone the repo and run

```
pnpm install
```

Then run

```
pnpm run dev
```

to start the development server.

You'll need to add your own OpenAI API Key, which will be saved in the application's state and will therefore be wiped upon browser refresh or session end.

Presets can be saved and are stored in your browser's IndexDB.
