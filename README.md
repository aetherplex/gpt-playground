# Enhanced GPT Playground

An enhanced version of OpenAI's playground (https://platform.openai.com/playground).

Still a WIP.

To get started, clone the repo and run

```
pnpm install
```

You'll need to add your OpenAI API key to a fresh `.env` file

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR-KEY>"
```

Then you can run

```
pnpm run dev
```

to start the development server.
